Small dollar loans are short-term, low-cost loans banks and credit unions offer. They provide a federally regulated alternative to expensive payday loans or for borrowers who canâ€™t qualify for low personal loan rates.  Banks and credit unions that offer them must follow strict rules to make sure they are affordable with maximum loan amounts of $2,500 or less.

Rather than credit scores, lenders base approval on your banking behavior and account standing. That means you may qualify for a small dollar loan if you manage your checking account well.
