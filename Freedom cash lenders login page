A small dollar loan provides a reasonably priced option for consumers who don’t qualify for a personal loan. They’re available to borrowers across the credit spectrum and may be approved based on a review of your banking activity rather than your credit history.
That means rather than looking at credit history issues that may have happened years ago, they approve your loan based on the past few months of deposits and withdrawals. If you have regular deposits and withdrawals, the lender can review them to determine how much to lend you, allowing you to qualify even with a very low credit score.
