Freedom cash lenders loan

Small dollar loans can’t exceed $2,500, and many lenders set their maximums much lower. The six big banks reviewed in a recent Pew study capped amounts between $500 and $1,000. Some credit unions in the same study offered larger maximums between $1,500 and $2,000.
If you need more than that, you may need to seek an alternative, like a bad credit personal loan.
Must have an active checking account
If you don’t have a current checking account or have a lot of charges for insufficient funds or overdraft fees on your account, you may not qualify for a small dollar loan. Some banks and credit unions are more lenient regarding checking account requirements than others. Consider opening a second-chance checking account and ask them if they participate in small dollar loans.
